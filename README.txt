This is a Windows binary of thecplusplusguy's "FPS Game",
with just a couple quick modifications:

- Redircted I/O to print to console
- Adjustable screen resolution and fullscreen on/off feature
- Ammo display/health/etc menu isn't clipped by other geometry

Source files I edited:

- game.h
- game.cpp
- main.cpp

I documented my changes with comments, and my comments all contain the
signature "Peter: " (as Peter is my first name).
